# Poem Generator 📝

**📖 Introduction**  
The Poem Generator is a fun and creative project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate poems based on user input. Whether you provide a single word, a theme, or a mood, the generator crafts meaningful verses that resemble human-written poetry.
This project is built in Python and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and learning. It demonstrates the power of language models in generating artistic text, blending programming with creativity.  
  
**Why this project?**  
* To explore how AI and NLP can be applied in a creative domain.
* To practice working with text generation models and libraries like transformers.
* To provide users with a simple and interactive way to generate poetry.

What makes it interesting?  
* You can create poems on any theme or topic (love, nature, friendship, sadness, motivation, etc.).
* Each run can produce unique verses, making the output different every time.
* It shows how technology can be used not just for solving problems but also for artistic expression.
